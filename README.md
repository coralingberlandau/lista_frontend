### Workflow

1. **Share a List by Email:**
   - When sharing, the user will provide the email of the person they want to share with, along with the permission level (`read-only` or `full-edit`).
   - The system will look up the user by email, and then save the list's share information, including the permission level.
   
2. **Get Shared Lists:**
   - When the shared user accesses the shared list, they can retrieve it along with the permission details.

3. **Update Share Permissions:**
   - The user who shared the list can update the permissions of the shared list.

 * This allows flexibility in how lists are shared and managed between users while allowing the user to set different levels of permissions.

# Welcome to your Expo app üëã

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
